## In this analysis, we are trying to understand: 
>- How far from a park to apartments tend to be when they mention park in their listing?
>- Does the inclusion of a park in an apartment listing have a relationship to the listing price, distance or the language/topics of the property descriptions? E.g. do apartments that mention parks in their posts rent for higher than those that don't or focus on different topics/utilize different language for marketing?

To get to the bottom of these questions, we scraped craigslist postings, sorted for park mentions in the description compared prices of listings that mention parks and the median gross rent in their neighborhood, conducted topic modeling for different property types, and measured the distance between listings that mention parks and the nearest park.

### STEP ONE: Scraping
We scraped ~11,000 apartment listings from craigslit in Los Angeles (on June 13, 2023) - see the "Scraping" Notebook for more detail - and saved them in a dataframe called combined_df. This scrape pulled apartment descriptions and other relevant information like the location of the post (latitude and longitude) as well as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and number of bedrooms. 

### STEP TWO: Sorting
Next we filtered through the scrapping data to identify listings that mention parks. To do so, we looped through the listing descriptions marking them as "true" for parks mentioned if their description included the name of a park from a LA DataHub provided list of parks in LA County or a term like trails or hiking that alludes to a public park without naming the specific park. Once we deleted dupplicates and null values our 9,000 listings went down to around 7,500. Of those 7,500 roughly 20% included a mention of parks in the listing (1,450)

### STEP THREE: Price Analysis
We went on to take a closer look at the apartments to identify any relationships between price of the apartment and the inclusion or absence of a park in the listing. To do so we grouped the apartments by census tract and found the average listing price for each tract as well as the average listing price for the apartments that include parks in their listing. Generally we found: 
> 1. the median price of listings that mention parks is **25.40 dollars more expensive per bedroom** than the median listing price in each census tract 
> 2. the median price of listings that don't mention parks is **26.40 dollars less expensive per bedroom** than the median listing price of all listings in the tract, suggesting that the listings that mention parks in their posts tend to be more expensive than average, maybe by roughly 25 dollars a month (or 300 dollars a year). That saidn, when we look a little more holistically at the difference between average and median rent price per census tract and the average and median rent price in just the listings that mention parks, it get a little blurry and hard to track a consistent relationship. 

### STEP FOUR: Topic Modeling


### STEP FIVE: Distance Analysis
We went on to take a closer look at the apartments to see what distances people tend to be from parks when they list them in their craigslit post. We measured the distance of listings that included parks to the nearest parks. We then converted this distance to line geometry and mapped it. We then counted listings plotted by intervals of 200 meters from parks. The data showed that the highest number of listings were concentrated between 200 and 400 meters from their nearest parks. The median and mean were very close 400 meters as well. Lastly, we ran a simple regression between distance and price and did not find there to be a significant relationship. However, we also note limitations in our data analysis and gathering process about the relation between distance to parks and rent as questions to be taken up in greater depth in the future.
